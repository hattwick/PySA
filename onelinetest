# convert a=2+2 and print a+a .... in one line of code

import math
#First the control

a=2+2
print(a+a)

# Labmas add a lot of flexibility

print (lambda a:a+a)(2+2)

#  print [a + a for a in [2+ 2][0]



# Determine how to allow function def in blocks of clode:

# def f(x):
    return x*10

# print f(3)

# print (lambda f: f(3))(lambda x: x*10)


# What about operations that don't assign to a variable?

do_something()
print 42

Since output value of do_something isn't used, funnel it to unused variable _.' \

print (lambda _: 42)(do_something())

# or

print (do_something(), 42)[1])



# put it all toggether

# if/else

if True:
    x = 5
else:
    x = 10
print x * 100


#...create conditional expression (B if A else C plus continuation passing

def continuation(x):
    print x*100

if True:
    x=5
    continuation(x)
If False:
    x=10
    continuation(x)



# answer is a big nested lambda

# While loop

x = 5
def whilte_loop(x):
    if x<20:
        x=x+4
        while_loop(x)
    else:
        print x
while_loop(x)


# Imports are not as hard as they seem ... __import__ takes care of that

rnd = __import__('random')
